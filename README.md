## Description

This repository contains the Python code used to analyze visitor responses to a survey distributed as part of the [Virtual Water Gallery](https://www.virtualwatergallery.ca) art-science (ArtSci) project. The survey aimed to assess changes in knowledge, attitudes, and behaviours related to water and climate change among gallery visitors. The code was used to generate graphics for a manuscript currently under review at PLOS Climate (Arnal and Schuster-Wallace, 2024). The analysis focuses on responses from gallery visitors. For the project participants' surveys, a single plot is generated using data from a different Excel document (not shared). Due to ethical considerations, the actual data used for the manuscript are not shared. Instead, we provide a toy dataset to allow you to run the code but not reproduce the exact manuscript results. For more information about the results, see our manuscript linked at the bottom of this file.

## Repository Structure

- ðŸ“„ `survey_analysis.ipynb`: A Jupyter Notebook containing a documented Python code to carry out the survey analysis and plotting. Make sure to have all the Python packages needed to run the code before hand. If you're new to Jupyter notebooks, you might want to [check out some resources](https://jupyter.org/) on how to use them effectively.
- ðŸ“„ `toy_data.xlsx`: An Excel document with fake data to be able to run the provided code.

## Contribution

I welcome and appreciate contributions from the community! If you're interested in improving this notebook, here's how you can contribute:

1. Fork and Clone: Fork this repository to your account and clone it locally to make your changes.

2. Create a Feature Branch: For each new feature or significant change, create a separate branch in your repository. This helps in keeping track of different contributions and ensures that the main branch remains stable.

3. Discuss Major Changes: If you're considering a major change or addition, open an issue first. This way, we can have a discussion about the proposed changes, their impact, and how they fit into the project's roadmap.

4. Commit Your Changes: Make your changes in your feature branch and commit them with clear, descriptive commit messages. Your commit messages should succinctly explain the changes and their rationale.

5. Test Your Changes: Ensure that your changes do not break existing functionality. Adding tests for new features is highly encouraged.

6. Create a Pull Request: Once you're ready, submit a pull request to merge your changes into the main branch. Provide a clear description in the pull request about the changes and their purpose.

7. Code Review: Your pull request will be reviewed by the maintainers. Engage in the review process if there are comments or suggestions.

8. Merge: Once your pull request is approved, it will be merged into the main branch.
